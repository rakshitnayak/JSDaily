/*
An expression’s evaluation can result in type conversions. These are called implicit conversions, 
as they happen automatically without the programmer’s intervention. For example, using the + operator 
between a string and a number causes the concatenation of the two values into a string result. */

const f = 100;
// Show "Variable f contains the value 100"
console.log("Variable f contains the value " + f);

/*
JavaScript is extremely tolerant in terms of type conversion. However, sometimes conversion isn’t possible. 
If a value fails to convert into a number, you’ll get the result NaN (Not a Number). */
const g = "five" * 2;
console.log(g); // Show NaN

/*
Sometimes you’ll wish to convert the value of another type. This is called explicit conversion. 
JavaScript has the Number() and String() commands that convert the value between the parenthesis to a 
number or a string.*/
const h = "5";
console.log(h + 1); // Concatenation: show the string "51"
const i = Number("5");
console.log(i + 1); // Numerical addition: show the number 6
