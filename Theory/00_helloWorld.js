/**This program displays the text "Hello from JavaScript!" in the console, a zone displaying textual information available 
in most JavaScript environments, such as browsers.
To achieve this, it uses a JavaScript command named console.log(), whose role is to display a piece of information. 
The text to be displayed is placed between parentheses and followed by a semicolon, which marks the end of the line.

Displaying a text on the screen (the famous Hello World all programmers know) is often the first thing youâ€™ll do when 
you learn a new programming language. */
console.log("hi this is javascript");

//A string in JavaScript is text surrounded by quotation marks, such as "This is a string"
// \n to add a new line within a string
console.log("This is \na multiline string");

/*the + operator has a special meaning when applied to two string values. It will join the two chains together,
 and this operation is called a concatenation.*/
console.log("Hel" + "lo");
