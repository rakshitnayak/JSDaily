What is recursion?
A process (a function in our case) that calls itself

How recursive functions work
Invoke the same function with a different input until you reach your base case

Base Case
- The condition when the recursion ends.
- This is the most important concept to understand 

So the two essential parts of a recursive function!
- Base Case
- Different Input

recursive function example

function countDown(num){
    if(num <= 0) {
        console.log("All done!");
        return;
    }
    console.log(num);
    num--;
    countDown(num);
}

Although the above function can be written using for loop logic, this is just a demonsration for recursion

Now lets call countDown(3);
-it will console.log 3
-it will now call countDown(2)
-it will console.log 2
-it will now call countDown(1)
-it will console.log 1
-it will now call countDown(0)
-it will console.log("All done!)
